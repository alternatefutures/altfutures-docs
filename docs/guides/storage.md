# Storage Management

::: warning Web App Coming Soon
The web interface for storage management is currently in development. Use the [CLI](../cli/) or [SDK](../sdk/) to manage your decentralized storage.
:::

Manage decentralized storage across IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave.

## Storage Dashboard

::: warning Coming Soon
The Storage Dashboard will be available once the web app launches.
:::

View all your stored content in one place:

- **Storage Items** - Files, sites, and agent data
- **Network Distribution** - Storage by network (IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave)
- **Total Size** - Aggregate storage usage
- **Monthly Cost** - Current storage costs

## Storage Networks

### IPFS

**Content-addressed storage with pinning:**

- Files identified by CID (Content Identifier)
- Pinned via Pinata, Web3.Storage, or Lighthouse
- Fast retrieval via global gateways
- Mutable pointers via IPNS

**Use cases:**
- Website hosting
- Dynamic content
- Frequently updated files

### Filecoin

**Decentralized storage marketplace:**

- Storage deals with miners
- Cryptographic proof of storage
- IPFS-compatible CIDs
- Cost-effective for large datasets

**Use cases:**
- Data archival
- Backup storage
- Large file storage

### Arweave

**Permanent, immutable storage:**

- Pay once, store forever
- Blockweave data structure
- Built-in content delivery
- Immutable by design

**Use cases:**
- NFT metadata
- Legal documents
- Historical records
- Permanent websites

## Managing Storage Items

::: warning Coming Soon
Web interface for managing storage items is in development. Use CLI/SDK for now.
:::

### View Details

Click on any storage item to see:

- **CID/Transaction ID** - Unique identifier
- **Size** - File size
- **Network** - Storage network
- **Created** - Upload date
- **Last Accessed** - Last retrieval time
- **URL** - Public access link
- **Pinned** - Pin status (IPFS only)

### Actions

- **Pin/Unpin** (IPFS) - Control pinning status
- **Copy CID** - Copy content identifier
- **Open in Gateway** - View in browser
- **Download** - Download file
- **Delete** - Remove from storage

### Filtering

Filter storage items by:

- **Network** - IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave
- **Type** - Site, Agent, File
- **Size** - Size ranges
- **Date** - Upload date

### Search

Search storage by:
- File name
- CID or transaction ID
- Type or network

## Pinning Management (IPFS)

### What is Pinning?

Pinning keeps content available on IPFS by ensuring at least one node stores and serves it.

### Pin Providers

We integrate with multiple pinning services:

- **Pinata** - Fast, reliable pinning
- **Web3.Storage** - Free tier available
- **Lighthouse** - Filecoin-backed pinning

### Pin Status

- **Pinned** - Content is actively pinned
- **Unpinned** - Content may become unavailable
- **Pinning** - Pin operation in progress
- **Failed** - Pin operation failed

## Storage Analytics

### Usage Over Time

Track storage growth:
- Daily/weekly/monthly charts
- Network breakdown
- Cost trends

### Cost Analysis

Understand storage costs:
- Cost by network
- Cost by project
- Cost projections

## Next Steps

- [Deploying Sites](./sites.md) - Deploy sites to storage networks
- [Billing](./billing.md) - Understand storage costs
- [Best Practices](./best-practices.md) - Optimize storage usage
