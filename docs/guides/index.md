# Platform Guides

Welcome to the Alternate Futures platform guides. These guides will help you get started and master the platform.

## What is Alternate Futures?

Alternate Futures is a platform that lets you deploy websites and AI agents to **decentralized infrastructure**—meaning your applications run on distributed networks instead of centralized cloud providers like AWS or Google Cloud.

### Why Decentralized?

- **No Single Point of Failure** - Your apps stay online even if one server goes down
- **Censorship Resistant** - No single company can take your site offline
- **Cost Effective** - Often cheaper than traditional cloud hosting for static content
- **Web3 Native** - Built for the decentralized web with crypto payments and wallet integration
- **Permanent Storage** - Options for truly permanent, immutable hosting

### What Can You Build?

**Just like Vercel or Netlify:**
- **Personal Portfolios** - Showcase your work with a fast, globally distributed site
- **Documentation Sites** - Host your project docs with version history and automatic deployments
- **Landing Pages** - Create marketing sites for your products or services
- **Blogs** - Static site generators like Astro, Hugo, or Jekyll hosted permanently
- **Company Websites** - Corporate sites with custom domains and SSL
- **SaaS Frontends** - React, Vue, or Svelte apps with API backends

**Plus Decentralized Features:**
- **NFT Projects** - Metadata storage, galleries, and marketplaces with immutable content
- **AI Agents** - Chatbots and AI assistants that run 24/7 on Discord, Twitter, and Telegram
- **Container Registries** - Self-hosted Docker registries for your CI/CD pipelines
- **Censorship-Resistant Apps** - Sites that can't be taken down by any single entity
- **Permanent Archives** - Content that lasts forever without ongoing hosting fees

**Privacy-Focused Use Cases:**
- **Whistleblower Platforms** - Anonymous document sharing without server logs or centralized tracking
- **Activist Websites** - Content that can't be censored or seized by authorities
- **Privacy-First Apps** - Run functions with SGX encryption where not even the host can see your data
- **Journalist Archives** - Permanent, tamper-proof storage for sensitive documents
- **Alternative Social Networks** - Build platforms without corporate surveillance or data mining

### Who Is This For?

- **Web Developers** wanting to try Web3 hosting without complexity
- **Crypto/NFT Projects** needing reliable decentralized infrastructure
- **Privacy Advocates** who want hosting without corporate surveillance or data mining
- **Journalists & Activists** requiring censorship-resistant publishing platforms
- **Teams Building Censorship-Resistant Apps** requiring unstoppable hosting
- **Anyone Seeking Alternatives** to centralized cloud providers who control your data
- **Content Creators** who want true ownership of their work
- **Learners** curious about decentralized technology
